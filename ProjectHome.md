# An Isometric RPG called BattleStone. #

Still in development. A simple engine is available for download (Uses DirectX)
It plots a maze with floors, walls and a single character to explore the maze.
It reads the map to plot from a text file, and the sprites to use from a single
.png file. (A long way from being a fully functional engine)

The game editor _BattleEdit_ (Developed in vb.net with GDI+) is also still in
development, but a bit further down the track. It allows you to define header information
for floor, wall and object sprites (including animating therm and defining areas that may
or may not be walked over)

The beginnings of a map editor will be built into this within the next week or so,
so check back around the 14th November 2007 for further updates.
